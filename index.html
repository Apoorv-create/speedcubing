                <p>A legacy</p>
            </i>
            <p>A History of cubing which includes Rubik's Cube and other related puzzles. Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Ernő Rubik, a Hungarian designer and architect living and working in Budapest. Initially known as the "Magic Cube", production began in Hungary in late 1977 and small numbers of Cubes were reaching the hands of mathematicians in the West in 1978. In 1979 a major US toy company, Ideal, signed a licensing agreement and launched Rubik's Cube into international markets in 1980. It quickly became a huge craze, peaking in 1981, and only ending in late 1982.It also became the three of the most sold items on Earth(other being the harry potter books and iphone).</p><img id="piccube" src="erno_rubik.jfif">
